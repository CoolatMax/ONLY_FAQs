# ❓ FAQ Documentation Portfolio

### _Converting common friction points into self-service solutions._

## 📌 Philosophy

# 

I treat FAQs as a living extension of the product. My goal is to anticipate user confusion before it reaches a support agent. I follow the **KCS (Knowledge-Centered Service)** methodology:

*   **Searchability:** Writing questions from the user’s perspective (using their language).
    
*   **Actionability:** Every answer must provide a clear "Next Step" or solution.
    
*   **Conciseness:** Stripping away fluff to provide the fastest "Time-to-Resolution."

3. docs: create FAQ section and link to README: https://github.com/OperationsPAI/OperationsPAI.github.io/pull/8

## 🛠 FAQ Architecture & Tools 

I use a structured approach to ensure information is easy to find and maintain:

*   **Taxonomy:** Categorizing FAQs into _Getting Started_, _Security_, _Billing_, and _Troubleshooting_.
    
*   **Version Control:** Using Git to track FAQ updates alongside product releases.
    
*   **Feedback Loops:** Analyzing support logs to identify new recurring "pains" to document.

If your support team is overwhelmed by repetitive questions, I can help build the "Self-Service" layer.
